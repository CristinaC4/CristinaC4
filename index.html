	<td>I used Adobe Express to express my aesthetic and create my collage of pictures. As I looked through my Pinterest boards for pictures that caught my eye, I decided to focus on one color, pink. For my aesthetic, I chose pictures that were pink or had a "girly" vibe. In each picture, I have included a combination of things and places that hold a special meaning as it is a habit for me to capture a fraction of a special event or preserve a memory. I think my collage matches my aesthetic because it’s a collection of things I’ve and places visited. And I like to surround myself with a specific type of vibe. I believe in surrounding myself with the right people in the right places. Small details matter a lot to me. So I feel like my collage reflects my aesthetic well. </td>
   	<td>I was able to change the colors in my art by using the color plate and the swatches tool to change the color for every picture of my celebrity portrait. I used the color tool to adjust the color tones for every picture. For my project, I wanted music that combines different aspects of my life. Rauw Alejandro's music does just that. Through his music, I find a sense of healing and an escape from reality.</td>
   	<td>I used the tools by referring back to the instructions that were given and following a reference to my Sanrio character. I started by changing Inches to Pixels and changing the subdivisions from 4 to 1. Then I changed where it says Bicubic Automatic to Nearest Neighbor. Continuing, I started using the pencil tool to create my character and show its personality. My character looks like Pompompurin and Cinnamoroll from Sanrio. My character is wearing nothing special but they’re being their original self. My character would be in a game that expresses their personality and shows their purpose through adventures. Their purpose in the game would be to help guide the player in all of their adventures and give them real-life advice.</td>
